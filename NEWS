    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 14 and 15

-- Enhancements

* check_memory / meminfo lib: the command line option '-C|--caches'
  now does nothing but is still accepted for compatibility.
  The memory usage calculation has been reviewed and is now more
  accurate.  The changes are based on the (long) discussions and
  patches that have been recently posted in the procps mailing list.

* check_memory / meminfo lib: a fall-back has been implemented in
  order to provide the memory available counter for the linux kernels
  2.6.27 and above,

* check_cpu: add one decimal digit to the counters 'cpu_user',
  'cpu_system', 'cpu_idle', 'cpu_iowait', and 'cpu_steal'.

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 13 and 14
                     -= Korbielow 2014 release =-

-- Enhancements

* check_users: new '--verbose' mode, for debugging.

* check_uptime: new option '-m|--clock-monotonic' for retrieving the
  time of the linux monotonic clock instead of using the system 
  statistics returned by 'sysinfo()'.

* New library 'xstrtol' containing the function 'strtol_or_err' that
  was previosly duplicated in several plugins.

-- Fixes

* check_clock: option '--refclock': validate the input instead of
  returning crap when the date format is unsupported.

* check_readonlys: do not dereference a null pointer string in the
  output message when no readonly filesystems are detected.

* Minor fixes.

======================================================================

    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 12 and 13

-- Enhancements

* The build system, the plugins and libraries are been reworked in
  order to support some older Linux kernels and (gcc) compilers.
  The "nagios-plugins-linux" can now be compiled and run on older
  linux systems, like RHEL 5 (gcc 4.1.2, kernel 2.6.18).

* check_memory: new option '-a|--available' for selecting the kernel
  counter 'MemAvailable' instead of the default one (memory used).
  This feature requires a Linux kernel 3.14 or better.
  For older kernels the plugin falls back to the free memory counter.

-- Fixes

* check_tcpcount: do not exit with 'error opening /proc/net/tcp6'
  when the command line option '--tcp6' has not been specified.

* cpustats library: do not exit with an error message if 'softirq'
  cannot be found in /proc/stat'. This entry is not provided by old
  kernels.

=====================================================================
    
    Major changes between "nagios-plugins-linux" versions 11 and 12

* New plugin 'check_intr'.
* meminfo library: get 'MemAvailable' value from /proc/meminfo

  'count' is 1.

======================================================================
